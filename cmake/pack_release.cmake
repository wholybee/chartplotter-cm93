# Invoked (via `cmake -P`) by the `installer` custom target to build the NSIS
# installer as part of a Release build. It is a no-op for any other
# configuration, because the install payload (install(TARGETS ...) /
# install(FILES ...) with CONFIGURATIONS Release) is staged for Release only —
# running cpack on a Debug build would package nothing useful.
#
# Inputs (passed with -D by the target):
#   CFG          the build configuration ($<CONFIG>)
#   CPACK_CMD    full path to the cpack executable (CMAKE_CPACK_COMMAND)
#   CPACK_CONFIG path to the generated CPackConfig.cmake
#   BIN_DIR      the build directory (working dir for cpack)
